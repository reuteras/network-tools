# Container for zeek

This container is based on [zeek-docker](https://github.com/zeek/zeek-docker) from [Zeek](https://zeek.org/) with packages and some other tools included.

This is a work in progress!

## Resources

- [zeek](https://zeek.org/)
- [rita](https://github.com/activecm/rita) - Check for updates in [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/activecm/rita/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)
